# MiCard - My First Flutter Project

## Overview

**MiCard** is my first Flutter project, a simple digital business card that showcases my name, phone number, and Gmail address. This project marks the beginning of my journey into app development using the Flutter framework.

## Project Description

### 1. **Business Card Design**

**MiCard** replicates the look and feel of a physical business card. It features a clean and elegant design with the following details:

- **Name**: My full name.
- **Gmail Address**: My primary email address for communication.
- **Phone Number**: A contact number where I can be reached.


### 2. **User-Friendly Interface**

The app offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to view my contact information easily. It provides a straightforward and efficient way for potential contacts to get in touch with me.

### 3. **Flutter Framework**

This project was built using the Flutter framework, which allowed me to create a cross-platform mobile app with a single codebase. Flutter's widgets and libraries made it possible to design a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

## Customize MiCard

Feel free to customize **MiCard** to make it your own. You can update the project with your personal information, change the design, or add more features to showcase your skills and creativity as a Flutter developer.
